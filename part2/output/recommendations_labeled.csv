Baskeri & Basso,"The hidden backyard entrance leads to a bistro with wines, music, atmosphere, service and food to love. This is simple and honest cooking, like Baltic herring escabeche, steak tartar, fresh linguine, flank steak and great cheese. Look for the guy with the hat, patron Nicolas Thieulon, and tell him your wine wishes - mostly natural french and Italian, and enjoy the night. Hopeless to book, so walk ins after 9 PM should work. Or walk downstairs to the sister wine bar of BasBas.",no,2019-02-18 23:03:03.874,,Keep,high,specific_helpful
Noma,"Noma single handedly shaped the culinary landscape by its focus on the Nordic Region. Standing by its philosophy of Time and Place.

 It has evolved to be even more daring by showcasing three themes throughout the year. The Ocean, Plant Kingdom and Game Season. Each period is a showcase of the bounty that nature offers and Noma's creativity. A truly once in a lifetime experience.",no,2019-05-25 19:09:13.323,,Remove,high,marketing_or_ai_tone
Kosmos,"A true institution from 1923. Eat vorschmack and fried Baltic herring. 

Kosmos is a true institution in central Helsinki with the original interior. Founded in 1923 and still run by the same family, Kosmos has a unique atmosphere with a genuine feel of the old restaurant world. Eat vorschmack, fried Baltic herring, wienerschnitzel, creamed sweetbreads and pancakes with strawberry jam and have a cold beer and schnapps.",no,2022-10-19 12:32:03.906,,Recommendation needs editing,medium,spelling_issues

Hills Dumplings,"Hills dumplings is a trendy and relaxed restaurant with hip atmosphere in the heart of Punavuori making it good place for an after-work or a night-out. 
They offer very good dumplings with modern touch, I recommend trying the “new school”-dumplings. Other trendy Asian foods like fried chicken and bao buns are good but the dumplings are the reason to go there. 
As mentioned, the food is made with a modern twist so if you are looking for traditional Asian cuisine this is not the place for it.",no,2019-12-04 08:07:02.762,,Keep,high,specific_helpful
Aska,"When I travel I rarely want to hang out with other Swedes. But, I have been dying to dine with Aska and chef Fredrik Berselius who grow up in the northern parts of Stockholm. These days I think Fredrik is more of a New Yorker than a Sollentuna suburbian. But his cooking still carries a lot of his Nordic roots. From kohlrabi rolls to Danish donut, all throughout it is a great dinner. The furthest corner table to the left has a full view of the whole restaurant.

In the kitchen, Fredrik is directing with very small movements. Then, give a Swede some vendace roe and the party is on. Here served with a fluffy potato pancake inside an emulsion with elderflower. Give me some razor clams seasoned with preserved black pine and cucumber reduction and I’ll think it’s so f*in good I won’t even remember to take a photo.

Service here is carried out with professionalism and passion. GM/ Somm Rachel Paeck brings out some badass bottles; natural but not in the first over-stereotypical way. 

So, the grilled rye bread serving! Here, pine cones are steeped in sugar water to release the natural yeasts, and that water is used to create the natural yeast starter.

Clientele in Aska is a good mix. It's inclusive, not just on paper – but also for real manages to attract people from all paths of life. ",no,2019-12-05 14:14:56.712,,Recommendation needs editing,medium,messy_but_salvageable

Pastis,"Favourite iconic bistro of Meatpacking district. From breakfast to dinner.

Pastis was the heart of Meatpacking district when the area was renewed early 2000’s. During Trump and Covid it closed its doors when the whole area became temporarily more silent. Last year, it fortunately reopened, just 200 meters from the original location. Fantastic French casual bistro that is always full. Great bistro food, but the point is the amazing atmosphere. Both outside and inside . The best place to start or end your walk in the High Line, Whitney, Chelsea market or the gallery district.",no,2022-09-24 15:58:56.312,,Keep,high,specific_helpful

It’s an omakase-only (tasting menu) format and a quirky, fun experience with quality nigiri. ",no,2023-04-18 01:41:54.338,,Recommendation needs editing,medium,spelling_issues

Restaurant Sea Horse,"Hearty traditional food. Salmon soup, herring, meat and potato hash.

A classic. Sea horse is a casual restaurant that's been around since 1934. A very traditional local neighborhood restaurant in the Ullanlinna district. Big platters of hearty traditional food with salmon soup, herring platters, beef Lindström and their legendary ”pyttipannu” meal, potato and sausage hash. 
 
You can walk in or make a booking for bigger parties. The portions are huge and people tend to drink schnapps and beer with their food. Very old school, open seven days a week which is a rare thing in Helsinki. Go for Sunday lunch, have a herring platter, fish soup and pancakes with some strawberry jam and cream as dessert.

The Dining Room,"The US wastes over 41 million tons of food. Every.  Single. Year. That means 38% of all food in the US goes into the bin. Every. Single. Year. The equivalent of 145 billion meals. Every. Single. Year. This should shock everyone. Something should (must) be done about this. But nobody in the Good Old US of A seems to care. 

And you can see why. It’s not just the “shall I supersize that” mentality. It’s that Every. Single. Meal that you have in the US you can see the waste.  No; I don’t want a side with this. No don’t give me a doggy bag. Just give me a reasonably sized starter and main. So. That. There. Is. No. Waste. 

I remember the first time I went to the US with my wife. The first time we had a meal we ordered a starter and a main each. We learnt our lesson; after that, it was a starter to share and a main to share.  And no; I don’t need sides. Not even fries. 

I mention this not because the food at The Dining Room at Little Palm Island is super sized. It’s not; it’s the opposite. It’s perfect. A starter (appetiser) is a starter size; a ceviche that tastes superb and won’t fill you up. A main (entrees - really?  I mean WTF; what bit of the French language don’t you get?) is a main size; two beautiful fillets of fresh fish in tempura batter with a miso flavoured veloute. Not a portion that would feed a family for a week. This is sizing as it should be. 

But more than that, this is food as it should be. It is well prepared. It tastes good. And it’s not cheap. No; good food is not cheap. If you want cheap, go to McDonalds/KFC/Taco Bell/Subway/Shite Franchise Crapola. And there we are again with the problem; cheap, rubbish, calorie laden crap, that isn’t food and doesn’t deserve to be treated as such. But in the land of the free and the home of the brave, nobody cares. Food isn’t a thing to be treated as something to savour; it’s gut luggage. It’s my human right to stuff my face with cheap shite and chuck away what I can’t stuff in. Stuff the damage I’m doing to the planet. 

Please, I implore you; forgo the cheap, the crap and the average. Not just at Little Palm but always. Go to Little Palm, an island with 38 different kinds of palm tree, a sunset to die for, a perfect view of Orion, Kelly the heron and a resident osprey. And great, properly portioned food. 

This being America, don’t expect a waitress waiting for a tip from another sucker to help you as you wish to be seated, and nor is there cheese, but it’s a start. Rome wasn’t built in a day.

It's evident that they work hard to enhance the whole dining experience with diverse flavors and attention to detail.

One example is the variety of carefully thought out vinaigrettes offered with their green salad starter and side dish salad. Vinegrettes were not the same.
